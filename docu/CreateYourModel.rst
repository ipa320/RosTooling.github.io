Create your model
=================

You can create a new file with the extension `.ros2` in the `rosnodes` folder from the previously created `project <LearnRosModels.rst>`_ by right-clicking on the folder and selecting **New -> File**.

This will create an empty file where you can create your model. As a helper, you can use the `reference documentation <RosModelDescription.rst>`_ and press **Ctrl + Space** to use the auto-complete functionality.

If auto-complete or the grammar highlighting is not working, check that the file is opened with the "Ros 2 Editor" by right-clicking on the file and selecting **Open with...**.
