Extract models using static code analysis [|image1|]
====================================================

This tutorial requires the
`Docker <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/>`__
installation.

As the RosTooling leverages existing ROS code, one of the techniques to
create models is to extract them from existing code. For this purpose,
we created a plugin based on
`HAROS <https://github.com/git-afsantos/haros>`__ that generates
automatically ROS models.

The code of the extractor is publicly available under
`ros-model-extractors <https://github.com/ipa320/ros-model-extractors>`__.

Imagine we want to use the extractors to analyze the following ROS 2
package that contains code for two simple ROS nodes:
`cpp_basic_ros2 <https://github.com/ipa-nhg/cpp_basic_ros2>`__.

Following the instructions of the extractor repository, the commands to
be run to build the Docker container are:

::

   git clone https://github.com/ipa320/ros-model-extractors
   cd ros-model-extractors
   [sudo] docker build --tag=haros_humble -f docker/humble/Dockerfile .

Once it finishes, we can then call HAROS and the model generator. The
command is:

::

   [sudo] docker run -it haros_humble:latest /haros_runner.sh *package_name* *node_name* *type* *path_to_resulted_model* *workspace_path* "*github_repositoryA -b branch*" "*github_repositoryB*"...

For the case of the package we want to analyze it will be:

::

   [sudo] docker run -it haros_humble:latest /haros_runner.sh cpp_basic --all node . /home/extractor/ws "https://github.com/ipa-nhg/cpp_basic_ros2"

The output of this command will be the content for the models
corresponding to the artifacts found on the CMakeLists of the ROS2
package, in this case, **basic_pub_node** and **basic_sub_node**.

::

   ## Call the HAROS plugin to extract the ros-models ##
   ~~~~~~~~~~~
   Extraction finished. See the following report:
   INFO: Found artifact: basic_pub_node
   INFO: Found artifact: basic_sub_node
   ~~~~~~~~~~~
   ###########
   ~~~~~~~~~~~
   Print of the model: ./basic_pub_node.ros2:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~
   cpp_basic:
     artifacts:
       basic_pub_node:
         node: basic_pub_node
         publishers:
           'my_awesome_pub':
             type: 'std_msgs/msg/String'

   ~~~~~~~~~~~
   ###########
   ~~~~~~~~~~~
   Print of the model: ./basic_sub_node.ros2:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~
   cpp_basic:
     artifacts:
       basic_sub_node:
         node: basic_sub_node
         subscribers:
           'my_awesome_sub':
             type: 'std_msgs/msg/String'

   ~~~~~~~~~~~
   ###########

If you copy the output in a .ros2 file on the RosTooling the models and
their attributes will be parsed and interpreted. For simplification,
both artifacts can also be merged into a single file.

Another nice example to test is the
`aruco_ros <https://github.com/pal-robotics/aruco_ros>`__ package, its
corresponding command is:

::

   [sudo] docker run -it haros_humble:latest /haros_runner.sh aruco_ros --all node . /home/extractor/ws "https://github.com/pal-robotics/aruco_ros"

|image2| This is a very basic example. The extraction technologies have
a huge potential, unfortunately since the ROS 2 Humble distro the
extractor works only for simple Cpp code. Unfortunately, some changes on
the colcon build infrastructure and how it calls the clang compiler
broke our extraction tools. With ROS (1) and previous ROS 2 distros we
reached a 70% of efficiency.

We are looking for help and collaboration to fix the current issues we
are facing. If you are interested please contact Nadia (mailto:
`nhg@ipa.fhg.de <nhg@ipa.fhg.de>`__). THANKS!! :)

Many of the models you will see during the rest of the tutorials were
auto-generated using this method.
